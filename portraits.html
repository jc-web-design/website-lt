    With Historic Jazz Greats
    </h3>
  <p class="text-muted">by Lilian Terry</p>
  <p> Having reached my 90th year of age, I look back at my last 70 years of activity in the world of jazz music and realize my extraordinary good fortune in having lived and worked in the midst of historically important artists. </p>
  
  <p>Through all the many years, they have accepted me, befriended me and finally given me their trust, with sincere reciprocal affection. I own a large collection of recorded interviews where the artist was free to discuss and declare, regarding all subjects of interest to him: from music to politics, to religion and family life.</p>

  <p>Alas, many of them have left us, some too soon.  Therefore, I considered that I owed it to them and to their public, all over the world, that they should be loved not only for their artistic worth, abundantly publicized, but for their private, almost shy, human way of being, which I am able to share with our readers.</p>

    <h3>Louis Armstrong</h3>
    
    <p>(aka Luigi Braccioforte)</p>

    <p>From the early Fifties we, devoted jazz fans in Italy, had enjoyed the visits of Satchmo who had become a beloved friend whom we would  welcome at Ciampino airport - or at the Rome railway station - with the Roman New Orleans Jazz Band playing noisily “When the Saints come marching in”, to his roaring, laughing delight.   
    </p>

    <p>It must be known that during the war years of Fascism, when jazz music had been forbidden in Italy, still the national radio would play the "Malinconie di San Luigi" by Luigi Braccioforte.

    <p>
      When the European Jazz Federation was created at the Warsaw Jazz Jamboree in October 1967 I had attended, representing Italy.  Thereafter, we met at the annual “work meeting” in Vienna which usually concluded its session with a concert by an international artist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Informed that our 1978 conference would host one of the new star pianists that I was promoting on my Italian radio programme, I was delighted at the idea of taping an interview, provided he was approachable.  I need not have worried for Chick Corea proved to be a delightful young man.  We had long conversations about the Italian scene as his father, Armando, was of Italian origin; and he agreed to tape an interview for my programme called “Jazz: Black and White” regarding the expansion and transformation of Jazz music from the United States to all Continents of the World.

        At the annual Jazz-At-The-Philharmonic concerts in Rome, icy Norman Granz would not allow any fraternisation between his artists and the public.   The same “stand off” rule applied also to the Ellington and Fitzgerald tours.   But there was one occasion when Mario de Crescenzo and I managed to outsmart the Granz.   Mario was a ‘jazz-person’, a special breed of jazz connoisseur as well as record collector, whose medical career was with the Nutrition Division of FAO of the UN and who befriended many well-known jazz musicians such as Stephane Grapelly and Django Rheinhard.   Famous or unknown, we all enjoyed his great jazz parties at his country home on the outskirts of Rome.   We met daily at work at FAO and were often involved together in the Roman jazz nightlife.
