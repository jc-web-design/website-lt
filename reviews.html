    <h4>Sister of the Soul </h4>

<img class="downbeat-image" src="images/Lilian-Terry-Downbeat-Review.png" alt="Downbeat Review">

    <p>Masterpiece jazz recordings evoke perfect states of being and a transcendent response. Similarly, in books, when authorship captures a character’s personality, it creates a sense of immediacy, connects the reader, and time just disappears.</p>

    <p>Italian jazz vocalist/TV and radio director/producer Lilian Terry’s ageless jazz memoir <cite>Dizzy, Duke, Brother Ray and Friends</cite> (University of Illinois Press) celebrates intimate friendships with treasured elite American jazz
      recording artists. Piqued with a keen sense of curiosity, Terry established a network of close friendship bonds when working as a vocalist, producer/journalist and translator in the 1960s with a who’s who of star talent. <cite>Dizzy, Duke,
        Brother Ray and Friends</cite> is centered around those friendships, and the book feels fresh and current due to Terry recapturing the humanity and camaraderie from those experiences. </p>

    <p>Terry presents new jazz stories from Europe during the era in America when almost every family had a Dave Brubeck album near the turntable, children played with Slinkys and hula hoops, and shag carpets were vogue. Civil Rights Movement hero
      Martin Luther King Jr. was passionately inspiring the nation.</p>

    <p> <cite>Dizzy, Duke, Brother Ray and Friends</cite> documents Cairo-born jazz personality Terry’s unions with her RAI (National Italian Radio and TV network) interview subjects and focuses on her lifelong family friendships with mega-talents
      Dizzy Gillespie, Duke Ellington, Ray Charles, Max Roach, Horace Silver and Abbey Lincoln.</p>

    <p>It’s about déjà vu; you get the sense you have met with Terry before. Having that familiar, comfortable manner of making an artist feel at ease came naturally to her. Graced with a down-to-earth refinement, the talented vocalist and
      journalist chose to assist and befriend those artists who shared her creative world. </p>

    <p> Milestones include Terry’s special moments with Ellington, Billy Strayhorn penning lyrics to “The Star-Crossed Lovers” for the vocalist, and her recording tribute to Johnny Hodges and Strayhorn with Tommy Flanagan. Terry enjoyed a seven-year
      friendship with Ellington, picking up other friendships along the way, respecting and celebrating the culture of jazz and documenting its political essence. </p>

    <p>Terry’s interview subjects shared thoughts on Jim Crow. Max Roach explains, “In jazz, the properties are all laid out and we all know the law. Like in a democracy everyone has to be intelligent enough to know that we have to govern these
      properties together equally, and that is what jazz is about.” </p>

    <p>After establishing bonds with Gillespie in the mid-’60s, Terry acted as his personal interpreter in Italy and interviewed him for the RAI. They eventually established a Bassano del Grappa jazz school together from 1983 to 1991. In 1985 Terry
      and Gillespie recorded the LP <cite>Oo ShooBe-Doo-Be ... Oo-Oo ... Oo, Oo</cite> together. </p>

    <p> Gillespie spoke fondly in Terry’s memoirs about Charlie Parker’s influence: “When Bird came into my life, he brought a totally new dimension on how to attack a tune and how to swing it. ... We inspired each other with our differences.”</p>

    <p> <cite>Dizzy, Duke, Brother Ray and Friends</cite> offers a positive glimpse into the world of beloved jazz artist personalities with amusing anecdotes. From Ellington’s poetry to conversations with Roach, Charles, Silver and Gillespie,
      Terry’s shared experiences and interviews present a captivating look into the world of jazz and its private moments. </p>

    <p> Bill Evans reflects with Terry, “It’s like living with a certain tradition, a certain surrounding, therefore the language can change with time but the proceeding remains the same.” </p>

    <p> A great performer’s music is timeless and renowned personalities are largerthan-life. The artists in Terry’s book conjure up special eternal magic. New jazz stories are documented as Terry creates a comforting read nudging closer to the jazz
      greats. </p>

    <p><strong>The New York City Jazz Record</strong><br>
      <!-- May 2018<br> -->
      written by Kevin Canfield<br>

      <p>A radio host, concert organizer and accomplished vocalist, Lilian Terry played an important role on the Italian jazz scene for many years. Now in her 80s, she has written a jaunty memoir about the time she spent with some of the 20th
        century’s legendary musicians. </p>

      <p><cite>Dizzy, Duke, Brother Ray and Friends</cite> is a book of laudable, if modest, ambitions. Terry isn’t out to dish dirt and doesn’t spend much time writing about the music itself. But taken for what it is—a collection of mostly
        flattering character sketches— this is a likeable effort. </p>

      <p>Raised in Cairo and Florence, Terry began working for the Italian broadcaster RAI in the ‘60s. In the years that followed, she interviewed and befriended a host of visiting American jazz stars. Her fond memories of these artists fuel the
        book’s most vivid chapters. In Terry’s telling, Duke Ellington was a font of wry quotes—“I tour the world with a small case full of vitamins,” he told her—and Max Roach was a resourceful host when she visited the U.S. In the late ‘60s, Terry
        was traveling with Roach and his fellow AfricanAmerican bandmates when they were turned away by a racist Rhode Island innkeeper. The quickthinking drummer responded by arranging alternative accommodations for the group: “It was only the next
        afternoon…that Max told me, greatly amused, that we had been the guests of Lucky Luciano’s brother-in-law.” </p>

      <p>After Terry, the book’s central character is probably Dizzy Gillespie. Friends for more than a quarter-century, Terry and the trumpeter collaborated on music education programs and an album released by an Italian label (<cite>Oo-Shoo-Be-DooBe
          ...Oo, Oo ...Oo, Oo</cite>, Soul Note, 1985). Gillespie, she says, was a brilliant, complex person. He could be moody, Terry says, and as he approached his 60th birthday, Gillespie rebelled against the idea of wearing a hearing aid. Though
        “not a ‘Santa Claus’ kind of man,” Terry writes, Gillespie’s “love of life and devotion to his music had raised him well above his shortcomings.” </p>
