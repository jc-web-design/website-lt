    <h3 id="db">Sisters of the Soul</h3>
    <p>by Kerilie McDowall</p>
    <h5>DownBeat Magazine<br>January 2018</h5>
      
    <p>Masterpiece jazz recordings evoke perfect states of being and a transcendent response. Similarly, in books, when authorship captures a character’s personality, it creates a sense of immediacy, connects the reader, and time just disappears.</p>

    <p>Italian jazz vocalist/TV and radio director/producer Lilian Terry’s
        ageless jazz memoir <cite>Dizzy, Duke, Brother Ray and Friends</cite>
        (University of Illinois Press) celebrates intimate friendships
        with treasured elite American jazz
        recording artists. Piqued with a keen sense of curiosity, Terry
        established a network of close friendship bonds when working as a
        vocalist, producer/journalist and translator in the 1960s with a
        who’s who of star talent. <cite>Dizzy, Duke,
            Brother Ray and Friends</cite> is centered around those
        friendships, and the book feels fresh and current due to Terry
        recapturing the humanity and camaraderie from those experiences.
    </p>

    <blockquote class="border-start p-5 border-5 border-quote text-justify">
      It’s about déjà vu; you get the sense you have met with Terry before. Having that familiar, comfortable manner of making an artist feel at ease came naturally to her. Graced with a down-to-earth refinement, the talented vocalist and journalist chose to assist and befriend those artists who shared her creative world.
    </blockquote>

    <p>Terry presents new jazz stories from Europe during the era in
        America when almost every family had a Dave Brubeck album near the
        turntable, children played with Slinkys and hula hoops, and shag
        carpets were vogue. Civil Rights Movement hero
        Martin Luther King Jr. was passionately inspiring the nation.</p>

    <p> <cite>Dizzy, Duke, Brother Ray and Friends</cite> documents
        Cairo-born jazz personality Terry’s unions with her RAI (National
        Italian Radio and TV network) interview subjects and focuses on
        her lifelong family friendships with mega-talents
        Dizzy Gillespie, Duke Ellington, Ray Charles, Max Roach, Horace
        Silver and Abbey Lincoln.</p>
        
    <p>It’s about déjà vu; you get the sense you have met with Terry
      before. Having that familiar, comfortable manner of making an
      artist feel at ease came naturally to her. Graced with a
      down-to-earth refinement, the talented vocalist and
      journalist chose to assist and befriend those artists who shared
      her creative world. </p>

    <p> Milestones include Terry’s special moments with Ellington, Billy
      Strayhorn penning lyrics to “The Star-Crossed Lovers” for the
      vocalist, and her recording tribute to Johnny Hodges and Strayhorn
      with Tommy Flanagan. Terry enjoyed a seven-year
      friendship with Ellington, picking up other friendships along the
      way, respecting and celebrating the culture of jazz and
      documenting its political essence. </p>

    <p>Terry’s interview subjects shared thoughts on Jim Crow. Max Roach
        explains, “In jazz, the properties are all laid out and we all
        know the law. Like in a democracy everyone has to be intelligent
        enough to know that we have to govern these
        properties together equally, and that is what jazz is about.” </p>

    <p>After establishing bonds with Gillespie in the mid-’60s, Terry
        acted as his personal interpreter in Italy and interviewed him for
        the RAI. They eventually established a Bassano del Grappa jazz
        school together from 1983 to 1991. In 1985 Terry
        and Gillespie recorded the LP <cite>Oo ShooBe-Doo-Be ... Oo-Oo ...
            Oo, Oo</cite> together. </p>

    <blockquote class="border-start p-5 border-5 border-quote text-justify"> Gillespie spoke fondly in Terry’s memoirs about Charlie Parker’s influence: “When Bird came into my life, he brought a totally new dimension on how to attack a tune and how to swing it. ... We inspired each other with our differences.”</blockquote>

    <p> <cite>Dizzy, Duke, Brother Ray and Friends</cite> offers a
        positive glimpse into the world of beloved jazz artist
        personalities with amusing anecdotes. From Ellington’s poetry to
        conversations with Roach, Charles, Silver and Gillespie,
        Terry’s shared experiences and interviews present a captivating
        look into the world of jazz and its private moments. </p>

    <p> Bill Evans reflects with Terry, “It’s like living with a certain
        tradition, a certain surrounding, therefore the language can
        change with time but the proceeding remains the same.” </p>

    <p> A great performer’s music is timeless and renowned personalities
        are larger than life. The artists in Terry’s book conjure up
        special eternal magic. New jazz stories are documented as Terry
        creates a comforting read nudging closer to the jazz
        greats. </p>

    <div class="publication">

    </div>
    <p>by Michael Fitzgerald</p>
    <p>As a twentieth-century art form that grew up alongside the
        development of recording technology, jazz has spent much of its
        evolution with its primary sources preserved and available.
        Entering its second century, however, while the musical recordings
        remain, the accompanying stories are disappearing with each
        successive obituary. The last of those individuals who remember
        experiencing the music and musicians in the 1920s are gone, and we
        have all too few accounts from them. Only a few decades from now,
        students of jazz wishing to learn about the 1950s and 1960s will
        have only what has been recorded and preserved. There will be no
        opportunity for new original interviews and oral histories.</p>

    <p>Rarer still is information about the important aspects of
        personality and character that can be supplied only by close
        friends. Even among the artifacts that do survive, it is uncommon
        to find much insight into the personal lives of musicians. Many
        published interviews focus exclusively on the professional career
        (and many journalists only consider the latest release and the
        current band). Biographers can therefore find it difficult to
        present a picture of a musician – even a prolific one – that is
        well-rounded and complete, giving a sense of what a performer did
        in the time spent off the bandstand and outside of the recording
        studio and what was important to him. We can be most thankful for
        resources that do help with this task, such as this book.</p>

    <p>Lilian Terry’s background is quite out-of-the-ordinary. Born in
        Egypt in 1930 to Maltese and Italian parents, she undertook
        academic studies in Cairo and Florence. Her family loved music and
        Terry studied classical piano until age 17, developing an interest
        in jazz in her early teens. She participated in a variety of ways
        with jazz in Europe, beginning in the 1950s. As a singer, she was
        an active performer and recording artist. She also wrote lyrics
        for Italian films. In 1967, Terry represented Italy at the
        founding of the European Jazz Federation, and she served as vice
        president of its Division of Education. At the same time, she
        produced radio and television shows for Italy’s RAI network, and
        this activity led to some of her encounters with major figures of
        American jazz. Seven of these interactions (most of which spanned
        decades) are the subject of <cite>Dizzy, Duke, Brother Ray, and
            Friends.</cite></p>

    <p>Duke Ellington, whom Terry first met in 1966 at the Antibes Jazz
        Festival, always had a suave and sophisticated public persona,
        particularly around women. The account that Terry relates is very
        much in line with the anecdotal evidence that has been related
        from various sources. Ellington was a special favorite of hers,
        and this must have been an occasion that made an indelible
        impression. Terry has an excellent recall for detail (noting the
        color of Ellington’s bathrobe – blue, his favorite) and while the
        backstage dialogue may not be verbatim, it is certainly
        believable. Terry also has some supporting evidence. The July 26
        performance, including Ellington’s spoken introduction that
        references her, is now available on Verve’s Côte d’Azur Concerts
        eight-CD set. Her request for “The Star-Crossed Lovers” (which was
        not in the band’s current repertoire) must have had an impact on
        Ellington as the CD set reveals he included the piece no fewer
        than four times over the course of that week. As a sidebar to her
        Ellington recollections, Terry provides an amusing account of how
        she ended up recording an album with pianist Tommy Flanagan,
        including a lyric version of “The Star-Crossed Lovers” in 1982.</p>

      <p>Following the concert, Ellington invited Terry to join the band for
          a reception and she spent time with him on several occasions later
          that week. The following year in Italy, they met again, on which
          occasion the great conductor Herbert von Karajan made an
          appearance to congratulate Ellington. A 1968 interview from the
          Newport Jazz Festival is less personal, surely because it was
          taped for radio. It is nonetheless a valuable document. The
          chapter ends with an account of a 1969 television program that
          Terry did not allow to be broadcast because the producers wished
          to portray Ellington in a dishonest “rags-to-riches” narrative.
          Perhaps presciently, Ellington had required that Terry be granted
          the legal right of approval in the contract he signed.</p>

      <p>Compared to so much written about Ellington and his public persona,
          this book gives the sense that Ellington’s treatment of Terry was
          very typical of how he interacted with women. The relationships
          with singer Abbey Lincoln and drummer Max Roach (both together and
          separately) that she describes feel more authentic and personal.
          The Lincoln portions of the chapter radiate the warmth of close
          friendship, and contain less about the music and more about the
          woman. The Roach portions combine informal escapades (such as
          visiting with Lucky Luciano’s brother in Newport, Rhode Island)
          and more professional encounters. Roach talks race and politics in
          a substantial radio interview from the 1970s during the time when
          he was teaching at the University of Massachusetts, but much of
          this content has appeared in other sources. Terry was able to
          maintain good relations with both Lincoln and Roach after their
          marriage ended. This allows for a fuller picture, and it is
          revealing that, “while at every meeting Abbey would sooner or
          later mention ‘Roach,’ as she called Max, since their divorce Max
          had never once mentioned her name.” (p.54) One quibble: the
          description of Lincoln’s hairstyle as “her deliberate Angela Davis
          afro” (p.42) seems to miss the important point that it was Lincoln
          who was ahead of the curve, appearing at fashion shows in 1962 and
          1963 and attracting attention with her natural hair, years before
          Angela Davis.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>The chapter on Horace Silver begins with a long prelude to a 1968
          interview. Silver is friendly, but not especially forthcoming, and
          his answers are brief and to the point. There is a good deal of
          discussion about the mingling of jazz and rock, which was very
          much a hot topic at the time. A second interview from 1987 is more
          expansive, with Silver touching on the founding of the Jazz
          Messengers group with Art Blakey in the 1950s and his move from
          Blue Note Records to his own Silveto label in the 1980s. He also
          discusses his spiritual beliefs, which played a role in his
          transition from labels. This later conversation is much less rigid
          than the earlier one.</p>

      <p>Terry states that she and Ray Charles had “‘an affectionate
          friendship,’ meaning not a real love affair but a close, loving
          relationship,” (p.83) that they kept secret for more than ten
          years. They first met at the Newport Jazz Festival in 1968 and the
          resulting interview is presented in a paraphrased summary with
          occasional direct quotes. An interview from the following year is
          very brief and inconsequential, and another one from later in 1969
          is essentially a series of short introductions to musical
          selections that were to be played on Terry’s radio show. A 1970
          encounter is tantalizingly short, with Charles talking a little
          about his repertoire, singers who influenced him, and about his
          position straddling the pop and jazz styles. According to Terry,
          other radio interviews from the 1970s have been lost, but
          Charles’s 1978 and 1979 visits to Rome are represented in
          lengthier portions, with extended discussions of musical purity as
          well as racial issues and politics in the United States and
          elsewhere.</p>

      <p>The chapter on Bill Evans is the least substantial of the sections,
          as Terry really had only one interaction with the pianist. In the
          mid-1970s, she interviewed him at his hotel in Bologna for her
          radio program. The interview is by no means as personal as some of
          the others, but it is informal and revealing. Evans states that
          his best moments “are when I play the piano in total solitude,
          without the public; for I confess that I am not a ‘concert’
          pianist. When alone, I can communicate completely with my music.”
          (p.100) In spite of the brevity of this section, it is a worthy
          addition to the existing body of documentation on Evans.</p>

      <p>Approximately half of the book is devoted to Dizzy Gillespie, whom
          Terry first met in 1966. Their relationship was wide-ranging and
          continued until the trumpeter’s death in 1993. Terry was
          commissioned to translate Gillespie’s autobiography <cite>To Be or
              Not...To Bop</cite> into Italian, and Gillespie even recorded
          with Terry in 1985. Like Ellington, Gillespie presented a façade
          to the public, and the first few meetings saw him treat Terry with
          a comic flirtatiousness. In the early 1970s, however, that
          attitude “gave way to a relaxed familiarity. It was as if we had
          always known each other, feeling at ease like old friends.”
          (p.114)</p>

        </div>
      </div>

      <p>The story of Terry’s work on the Italian translation of Gillespie’s
          autobiography is quite unusual: to start with, the Italian
          publisher required it be shortened by forty percent, and the
          vernacular English was not easy to convert into an Italian that
          was agreeable to the higher-ups. Terry’s efforts were finally
          deemed acceptable and she was paid, but shortly thereafter, due to
          new ownership, the book’s publication was entirely canceled and
          her work was destroyed. Fortunately, additional interviews that
          she conducted regarding Gillespie’s visits to Italy do survive and
          are presented here. One very interesting aspect is the account of
          the Dizzy Gillespie Popular School of Music, which Terry
          co-founded in Bassano in 1983. It closed in 1996, three years
          after Gillespie’s passing.</p>

      <p>Of all the subjects in this book, it is Gillespie who is portrayed
          most completely. The coverage includes discussion of his
          composing, the musical innovations of bebop, and his relationship
          with Charlie Parker. He talks about religion, his family, even his
          diabetes. The reader is treated to not just an hour or an
          afternoon spent in the company of the artist, but multiple days in
          great detail. The anecdotes are not generic rehashes that have
          been told before elsewhere, but instead have a freshness and
          singularity that makes one think of a great improvisation. Because
          of the length and depth of their close friendship, Terry is
          comfortable enough to present her own assessment of Gillespie,
          which is very insightful.</p>

      <p>Throughout the book, Terry’s intelligence, compassion, curiosity,
          and tact shine through. She is consistently respectful (sometimes
          even flattering), but also bold. There are a number of times when
          meeker interviewers would have failed some of the “tests” that the
          artists, perhaps wary of an outsider, set for her. Especially in
          her interactions with Dizzy Gillespie, she is able to engage and
          challenge as an equal, as opposed to being a submissive
          interviewer. While Terry is a Catholic, her knowledge of religions
          allowed her to provide comprehensive answers to Gillespie’s
          inquiries about Islam. In turn, she took up his challenge to learn
          about the Baha’i faith, passing the detailed quiz he later
          administered with flying colors.</p>

      <p>The book’s lack of an index is an inconvenience, but not a great
          loss as the book is short and the sections are fairly discrete.
          Eleven pages of black-and-white photographs, mostly of Terry with
          each of the musicians, are included, though Silver, Charles, and
          Evans are not represented.</p>

      <p>While the book reveals a good deal about its fascinating author,
          this is not a biography of Terry. Neither is it a history of
          American jazz musicians in Europe from the 1960s to today. The
          individual sections have almost nothing in common, with the
          exception of Terry herself, and there is no real attempt to link
          the stories together in a cohesive manner to make any grander
          point. Regardless, this book contains a great deal of fascinating
          information, much of which has never been available elsewhere.
          Researchers of the seven subjects will find it very useful as yet
          another source that can be consulted and integrated into more
          focused projects. When the stories told are indeed each
          one-of-a-kind, they are priceless. </p>

          <p>by Kevin Canfield</p>
      </div>

      <p>A radio host, concert organizer and accomplished vocalist,
          Lilian Terry played an important role on the Italian jazz
          scene for many years. Now in her 80s, she has written a jaunty
          memoir about the time she spent with some of the 20th
          century’s legendary musicians. </p>

      <p><cite>Dizzy, Duke, Brother Ray and Friends</cite> is a book of
          laudable, if modest, ambitions. Terry isn’t out to dish dirt
          and doesn’t spend much time writing about the music itself.
          But taken for what it is — a collection of mostly
          flattering character sketches — this is a likeable effort. </p>

      <p>Raised in Cairo and Florence, Terry began working for the
          Italian broadcaster RAI in the ‘60s. In the years that
          followed, she interviewed and befriended a host of visiting
          American jazz stars. Her fond memories of these artists fuel
          the book’s most vivid chapters. In Terry’s telling, Duke
          Ellington
          was a font of wry quotes—“I tour the world with a small case
          full of vitamins,” he told her—and Max Roach was a resourceful
          host when she visited the U.S. In the late ‘60s, Terry
          was traveling with Roach and his fellow African American
          bandmates when they were turned away by a racist Rhode Island
          innkeeper. The quick-thinking drummer responded by arranging
          alternative accommodations for the group: “It was only the
          next afternoon...that Max told me, greatly amused, that we had
          been the guests of Lucky Luciano’s brother-in-law.” </p>

      <p>After Terry, the book’s central character is probably Dizzy
          Gillespie. Friends for more than a quarter-century, Terry and
          the trumpeter collaborated on music education programs and an
          album released by an Italian label (<cite>Oo-Shoo-Be-DooBe
              ...Oo, Oo ...Oo, Oo</cite>, Soul Note, 1985). Gillespie,
          she says, was a brilliant, complex person. He could be moody,
          Terry says, and as he approached his 60th birthday, Gillespie
          rebelled against the idea of wearing a hearing aid. Though
          “not a ‘Santa Claus’ kind of man,” Terry writes, Gillespie’s
          “love of life and devotion to his music had raised him well
          above his shortcomings.” </p>
