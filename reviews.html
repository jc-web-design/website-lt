            <p class="title">DownBeat Magazine</p>

            <img class="downbeat-image" src="images/Lilian-Terry-Downbeat-Review.png" alt="Downbeat Review">

            <p>Masterpiece jazz recordings evoke perfect states of being and a
                transcendent response. Similarly, in books, when authorship
                captures a character’s personality, it creates a sense of
                immediacy, connects the reader, and time just disappears.</p>

            <p>Italian jazz vocalist/TV and radio director/producer Lilian Terry’s
                ageless jazz memoir <cite>Dizzy, Duke, Brother Ray and Friends</cite>
                (University of Illinois Press) celebrates intimate friendships
                with treasured elite American jazz
                recording artists. Piqued with a keen sense of curiosity, Terry
                established a network of close friendship bonds when working as a
                vocalist, producer/journalist and translator in the 1960s with a
                who’s who of star talent. <cite>Dizzy, Duke,
                    Brother Ray and Friends</cite> is centered around those
                friendships, and the book feels fresh and current due to Terry
                recapturing the humanity and camaraderie from those experiences.
            </p>

            <p>Terry presents new jazz stories from Europe during the era in
                America when almost every family had a Dave Brubeck album near the
                turntable, children played with Slinkys and hula hoops, and shag
                carpets were vogue. Civil Rights Movement hero
                Martin Luther King Jr. was passionately inspiring the nation.</p>

            <p> <cite>Dizzy, Duke, Brother Ray and Friends</cite> documents
                Cairo-born jazz personality Terry’s unions with her RAI (National
                Italian Radio and TV network) interview subjects and focuses on
                her lifelong family friendships with mega-talents
                Dizzy Gillespie, Duke Ellington, Ray Charles, Max Roach, Horace
                Silver and Abbey Lincoln.</p>

            <p>It’s about déjà vu; you get the sense you have met with Terry
                before. Having that familiar, comfortable manner of making an
                artist feel at ease came naturally to her. Graced with a
                down-to-earth refinement, the talented vocalist and
                journalist chose to assist and befriend those artists who shared
                her creative world. </p>

            <p> Milestones include Terry’s special moments with Ellington, Billy
                Strayhorn penning lyrics to “The Star-Crossed Lovers” for the
                vocalist, and her recording tribute to Johnny Hodges and Strayhorn
                with Tommy Flanagan. Terry enjoyed a seven-year
                friendship with Ellington, picking up other friendships along the
                way, respecting and celebrating the culture of jazz and
                documenting its political essence. </p>

            <p>Terry’s interview subjects shared thoughts on Jim Crow. Max Roach
                explains, “In jazz, the properties are all laid out and we all
                know the law. Like in a democracy everyone has to be intelligent
                enough to know that we have to govern these
                properties together equally, and that is what jazz is about.” </p>

            <p>After establishing bonds with Gillespie in the mid-’60s, Terry
                acted as his personal interpreter in Italy and interviewed him for
                the RAI. They eventually established a Bassano del Grappa jazz
                school together from 1983 to 1991. In 1985 Terry
                and Gillespie recorded the LP <cite>Oo ShooBe-Doo-Be ... Oo-Oo ...
                    Oo, Oo</cite> together. </p>

            <p> Gillespie spoke fondly in Terry’s memoirs about Charlie Parker’s
                influence: “When Bird came into my life, he brought a totally new
                dimension on how to attack a tune and how to swing it. ... We
                inspired each other with our differences.”</p>

            <p> <cite>Dizzy, Duke, Brother Ray and Friends</cite> offers a
                positive glimpse into the world of beloved jazz artist
                personalities with amusing anecdotes. From Ellington’s poetry to
                conversations with Roach, Charles, Silver and Gillespie,
                Terry’s shared experiences and interviews present a captivating
                look into the world of jazz and its private moments. </p>

            <p> Bill Evans reflects with Terry, “It’s like living with a certain
                tradition, a certain surrounding, therefore the language can
                change with time but the proceeding remains the same.” </p>

            <p> A great performer’s music is timeless and renowned personalities
                are largerthan-life. The artists in Terry’s book conjure up
                special eternal magic. New jazz stories are documented as Terry
                creates a comforting read nudging closer to the jazz
                greats. </p>

            <p class="title">Association for Recorded Sound Collections Journal</p>

            <p>As a twentieth-century art form that grew up alongside the
                development of recording technology, jazz has spent much of its
                evolution with its primary sources preserved and available.
                Entering its second century, however, while the musical recordings
                remain, the accompanying stories are disappearing with each
                successive obituary. The last of those individuals who remember
                experiencing the music and musicians in the 1920s are gone, and we
                have all too few accounts from them. Only a few decades from now,
                students of jazz wishing to learn about the 1950s and 1960s will
                have only what has been recorded and preserved. There will be no
                opportunity for new original interviews and oral histories.</p>

            <p>Rarer still is information about the important aspects of
                personality and character that can be supplied only by close
                friends. Even among the artifacts that do survive, it is uncommon
                to find much insight into the personal lives of musicians. Many
                published interviews focus exclusively on the professional career
                (and many journalists only consider the latest release and the
                current band). Biographers can therefore find it difficult to
                present a picture of a musician – even a prolific one – that is
                well-rounded and complete, giving a sense of what a performer did
                in the time spent off the bandstand and outside of the recording
                studio and what was important to him. We can be most thankful for
                resources that do help with this task, such as this book.</p>

            <p>Lilian Terry’s background is quite out-of-the-ordinary. Born in
                Egypt in 1930 to Maltese and Italian parents, she undertook
                academic studies in Cairo and Florence. Her family loved music and
                Terry studied classical piano until age 17, developing an interest
                in jazz in her early teens. She participated in a variety of ways
                with jazz in Europe, beginning in the 1950s. As a singer, she was
                an active performer and recording artist. She also wrote lyrics
                for Italian films. In 1967, Terry represented Italy at the
                founding of the European Jazz Federation, and she served as vice
                president of its Division of Education. At the same time, she
                produced radio and television shows for Italy’s RAI network, and
                this activity led to some of her encounters with major figures of
                American jazz. Seven of these interactions (most of which spanned
                decades) are the subject of <cite>Dizzy, Duke, Brother Ray, and
                    Friends.</cite></p>

            <p>Duke Ellington, whom Terry first met in 1966 at the Antibes Jazz
                Festival, always had a suave and sophisticated public persona,
                particularly around women. The account that Terry relates is very
                much in line with the anecdotal evidence that has been related
                from various sources. Ellington was a special favorite of hers,
                and this must have been an occasion that made an indelible
                impression. Terry has an excellent recall for detail (noting the
                color of Ellington’s bathrobe – blue, his favorite) and while the
                backstage dialogue may not be verbatim, it is certainly
                believable. Terry also has some supporting evidence. The July 26
                performance, including Ellington’s spoken introduction that
                references her, is now available on Verve’s Côte d’Azur Concerts
                eight-CD set. Her request for “The Star-Crossed Lovers” (which was
                not in the band’s current repertoire) must have had an impact on
                Ellington as the CD set reveals he included the piece no fewer
                than four times over the course of that week. As a sidebar to her
                Ellington recollections, Terry provides an amusing account of how
                she ended up recording an album with pianist Tommy Flanagan,
                including a lyric version of “The Star-Crossed Lovers” in 1982.</p>

            <blockquote>
                "The anecdotes are not generic rehashes that have
                been told before elsewhere, but instead have a freshness and
                singularity that makes one think of a great improvisation."<br>
                -- Michael Fitzgerald
            </blockquote>

            <p>Following the concert, Ellington invited Terry to join the band for
                a reception and she spent time with him on several occasions later
                that week. The following year in Italy, they met again, on which
                occasion the great conductor Herbert von Karajan made an
                appearance to congratulate Ellington. A 1968 interview from the
                Newport Jazz Festival is less personal, surely because it was
                taped for radio. It is nonetheless a valuable document. The
                chapter ends with an account of a 1969 television program that
                Terry did not allow to be broadcast because the producers wished
                to portray Ellington in a dishonest “rags-to-riches” narrative.
                Perhaps presciently, Ellington had required that Terry be granted
                the legal right of approval in the contract he signed.</p>

            <p>Compared to so much written about Ellington and his public persona,
                this book gives the sense that Ellington’s treatment of Terry was
                very typical of how he interacted with women. The relationships
                with singer Abbey Lincoln and drummer Max Roach (both together and
                separately) that she describes feel more authentic and personal.
                The Lincoln portions of the chapter radiate the warmth of close
                friendship, and contain less about the music and more about the
                woman. The Roach portions combine informal escapades (such as
                visiting with Lucky Luciano’s brother in Newport, Rhode Island)
                and more professional encounters. Roach talks race and politics in
                a substantial radio interview from the 1970s during the time when
                he was teaching at the University of Massachusetts, but much of
                this content has appeared in other sources. Terry was able to
                maintain good relations with both Lincoln and Roach after their
                marriage ended. This allows for a fuller picture, and it is
                revealing that, “while at every meeting Abbey would sooner or
                later mention ‘Roach,’ as she called Max, since their divorce Max
                had never once mentioned her name.” (p.54) One quibble: the
                description of Lincoln’s hairstyle as “her deliberate Angela Davis
                afro” (p.42) seems to miss the important point that it was Lincoln
                who was ahead of the curve, appearing at fashion shows in 1962 and
                1963 and attracting attention with her natural hair, years before
                Angela Davis.</p>

            <p>The chapter on Horace Silver begins with a long prelude to a 1968
                interview. Silver is friendly, but not especially forthcoming, and
                his answers are brief and to the point. There is a good deal of
                discussion about the mingling of jazz and rock, which was very
                much a hot topic at the time. A second interview from 1987 is more
                expansive, with Silver touching on the founding of the Jazz
                Messengers group with Art Blakey in the 1950s and his move from
                Blue Note Records to his own Silveto label in the 1980s. He also
                discusses his spiritual beliefs, which played a role in his
                transition from labels. This later conversation is much less rigid
                than the earlier one.</p>

            <p>Terry states that she and Ray Charles had “‘an affectionate
                friendship,’ meaning not a real love affair but a close, loving
                relationship,” (p.83) that they kept secret for more than ten
                years. They first met at the Newport Jazz Festival in 1968 and the
                resulting interview is presented in a paraphrased summary with
                occasional direct quotes. An interview from the following year is
                very brief and inconsequential, and another one from later in 1969
                is essentially a series of short introductions to musical
                selections that were to be played on Terry’s radio show. A 1970
                encounter is tantalizingly short, with Charles talking a little
                about his repertoire, singers who influenced him, and about his
                position straddling the pop and jazz styles. According to Terry,
                other radio interviews from the 1970s have been lost, but
                Charles’s 1978 and 1979 visits to Rome are represented in
                lengthier portions, with extended discussions of musical purity as
                well as racial issues and politics in the United States and
                elsewhere.</p>

            <p>The chapter on Bill Evans is the least substantial of the sections,
                as Terry really had only one interaction with the pianist. In the
                mid-1970s, she interviewed him at his hotel in Bologna for her
                radio program. The interview is by no means as personal as some of
                the others, but it is informal and revealing. Evans states that
                his best moments “are when I play the piano in total solitude,
                without the public; for I confess that I am not a ‘concert’
                pianist. When alone, I can communicate completely with my music.”
                (p.100) In spite of the brevity of this section, it is a worthy
                addition to the existing body of documentation on Evans.</p>

            <p>Approximately half of the book is devoted to Dizzy Gillespie, whom
                Terry first met in 1966. Their relationship was wide-ranging and
                continued until the trumpeter’s death in 1993. Terry was
                commissioned to translate Gillespie’s autobiography <cite>To Be or
                    Not...To Bop</cite> into Italian, and Gillespie even recorded
                with Terry in 1985. Like Ellington, Gillespie presented a façade
                to the public, and the first few meetings saw him treat Terry with
                a comic flirtatiousness. In the early 1970s, however, that
                attitude “gave way to a relaxed familiarity. It was as if we had
                always known each other, feeling at ease like old friends.”
                (p.114)</p>

            <p>The story of Terry’s work on the Italian translation of Gillespie’s
                autobiography is quite unusual: to start with, the Italian
                publisher required it be shortened by forty percent, and the
                vernacular English was not easy to convert into an Italian that
                was agreeable to the higher-ups. Terry’s efforts were finally
                deemed acceptable and she was paid, but shortly thereafter, due to
                new ownership, the book’s publication was entirely canceled and
                her work was destroyed. Fortunately, additional interviews that
                she conducted regarding Gillespie’s visits to Italy do survive and
                are presented here. One very interesting aspect is the account of
                the Dizzy Gillespie Popular School of Music, which Terry
                co-founded in Bassano in 1983. It closed in 1996, three years
                after Gillespie’s passing.</p>

            <p>Of all the subjects in this book, it is Gillespie who is portrayed
                most completely. The coverage includes discussion of his
                composing, the musical innovations of bebop, and his relationship
                with Charlie Parker. He talks about religion, his family, even his
                diabetes. The reader is treated to not just an hour or an
                afternoon spent in the company of the artist, but multiple days in
                great detail. The anecdotes are not generic rehashes that have
                been told before elsewhere, but instead have a freshness and
                singularity that makes one think of a great improvisation. Because
                of the length and depth of their close friendship, Terry is
                comfortable enough to present her own assessment of Gillespie,
                which is very insightful.</p>

            <p>Throughout the book, Terry’s intelligence, compassion, curiosity,
                and tact shine through. She is consistently respectful (sometimes
                even flattering), but also bold. There are a number of times when
                meeker interviewers would have failed some of the “tests” that the
                artists, perhaps wary of an outsider, set for her. Especially in
                her interactions with Dizzy Gillespie, she is able to engage and
                challenge as an equal, as opposed to being a submissive
                interviewer. While Terry is a Catholic, her knowledge of religions
                allowed her to provide comprehensive answers to Gillespie’s
                inquiries about Islam. In turn, she took up his challenge to learn
                about the Baha’i faith, passing the detailed quiz he later
                administered with flying colors.</p>

            <p>The book’s lack of an index is an inconvenience, but not a great
                loss as the book is short and the sections are fairly discrete.
                Eleven pages of black-and-white photographs, mostly of Terry with
                each of the musicians, are included, though Silver, Charles, and
                Evans are not represented.</p>

            <p>While the book reveals a good deal about its fascinating author,
                this is not a biography of Terry. Neither is it a history of
                American jazz musicians in Europe from the 1960s to today. The
                individual sections have almost nothing in common, with the
                exception of Terry herself, and there is no real attempt to link
                the stories together in a cohesive manner to make any grander
                point. Regardless, this book contains a great deal of fascinating
                information, much of which has never been available elsewhere.
                Researchers of the seven subjects will find it very useful as yet
                another source that can be consulted and integrated into more
                focused projects. When the stories told are indeed each
                one-of-a-kind, they are priceless. </p>

            <p class="title">The New York City Jazz Record</p>

            <p>A radio host, concert organizer and accomplished vocalist,
                Lilian Terry played an important role on the Italian jazz
                scene for many years. Now in her 80s, she has written a jaunty
                memoir about the time she spent with some of the 20th
                century’s legendary musicians. </p>

            <p><cite>Dizzy, Duke, Brother Ray and Friends</cite> is a book of
                laudable, if modest, ambitions. Terry isn’t out to dish dirt
                and doesn’t spend much time writing about the music itself.
                But taken for what it is — a collection of mostly
                flattering character sketches — this is a likeable effort. </p>

            <p>Raised in Cairo and Florence, Terry began working for the
                Italian broadcaster RAI in the ‘60s. In the years that
                followed, she interviewed and befriended a host of visiting
                American jazz stars. Her fond memories of these artists fuel
                the book’s most vivid chapters. In Terry’s telling, Duke
                Ellington
                was a font of wry quotes—“I tour the world with a small case
                full of vitamins,” he told her—and Max Roach was a resourceful
                host when she visited the U.S. In the late ‘60s, Terry
                was traveling with Roach and his fellow AfricanAmerican
                bandmates when they were turned away by a racist Rhode Island
                innkeeper. The quickthinking drummer responded by arranging
                alternative accommodations for the group: “It was only the
                next afternoon…that Max told me, greatly amused, that we had
                been
                the guests of Lucky Luciano’s brother-in-law.” </p>

            <p>After Terry, the book’s central character is probably Dizzy
                Gillespie. Friends for more than a quarter-century, Terry and
                the trumpeter collaborated on music education programs and an
                album released by an Italian label (<cite>Oo-Shoo-Be-DooBe
                    ...Oo, Oo ...Oo, Oo</cite>, Soul Note, 1985). Gillespie,
                she says, was a brilliant, complex person. He could be moody,
                Terry says, and as he approached his 60th birthday, Gillespie
                rebelled against the idea of wearing a hearing aid. Though
                “not a ‘Santa Claus’ kind of man,” Terry writes, Gillespie’s
                “love of life and devotion to his music had raised him well
                above his shortcomings.” </p>
